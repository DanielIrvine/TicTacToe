HOW TO PLAY.

 You play as either 'X' or 'O'. Your objective is to make three marks in a line within the 3x3 grid that
 appears on screen. This can be in any direction: horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
 
 Your opponent is the computer who will try to block you and form its own row of three marks.
 
 1. After launching the app, choose whether you wish to play first or second. 
    If you choose to play first, you will be player 'X'. The game waits for you to make your opening move.
    If you choose to play second, you will be player 'O'. The computer will immediately
      play as 'X' and it becomes your turn.
 2. To make a move, tap in a square of the game board. You should see your X or O symbol appear in the square.
    The computer will then play immediately afterwards.
 3. Repeat step 2 until either you or the computer wins. A draw occurs when the grid is full but no winning
    line of three marks has been formed.
    
 The game is not easy to win. In fact, some say it is impossible. Good luck!
